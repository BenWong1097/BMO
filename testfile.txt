Codi: Salon all

audio aptaget install :easemcvcc:

Codi: Salon all

[aspistil] an FBQE-jpg

Convert it to text (OCR):

Codi: Salon all

teasexact page .jpg pagetext:
This can take the Pi anything from 1 to 10 minutes depending on the image...

Then you have a text ﬁle called pagelext.txt

Codi: Salon all

Cat: pagetext .txt:
